**Tech choices**

- I choose Vue3 as a framework for this project because it is the most popular framework in the world and it is easy to use.
- I choose Vite as a build tool because it is the fastest build tool in the world.
- I choose Vanilla CSS because it is the fastest way to style a website.
- I choose Vercel as a hosting service because it is easy to use and it has lots of free building minutes.
- I choose Github as a version control system because I'm very used to it.
